# Snake-in-python
This is a simple version of snake that me and a friend have made in python (using microsoft visual studio) with the help of a youtube tutorial.
The link to the video is : https://youtu.be/QFvqStqPCRU
The game is configured to run at a capped 144 frames per second and at a fixed resolution of 800x800, this does mean that a monitor with a resolution of 1600x900 or greater is recommended for the game to be played properly.
The pygame plugin for python was used as a basis for the game to make it easier to program.
Here are some screenshots of the game:
